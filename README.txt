epm_project_management is an "Enterprise Project Management" tool to help manage "projects" in use within an "enterprise".

Glossary
========
"Projects" are used to identify "Project" nodes on drupal.org. Things like themes, modules.

"Enterprises" are just organizations, but this tool is most likely only a valuable tool to help communicate if you have a large number of Drupal site builders, a separate security review team, and maybe your folks are distributed geographically or you have high turnover/use consultants making it hard for everyone to stay in agreement on which modules can or can't be used.
